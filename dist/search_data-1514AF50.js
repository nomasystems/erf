Design your API using OpenAPI 3.0. For example: [users.openapi.json](examples/users/priv/users.openapi.json).\n\n2. Add `erf` as a dependency in your `rebar3` project.\n```erl\n{deps, [\n    {erf, {git, \"git@github.com:nomasystems/erf.git\", {branch, \"main\"}}}\n]}.\n```\n\n3. Implement a callback module for your API. A hypothetical example for [users.openapi.json](examples/users/priv/users.openapi.json) would be [users_callback.erl](examples/users/src/users_callback.erl).\n```erl\n%% An  erf  callback for the users REST API.\n-module(users_callback).\n\n%%% EXTERNAL EXPORTS\n-export([\n    create_user/1,\n    get_user/1,\n    delete_user/1\n]).\n\n%%%-------------------------------------------------------\n%%% EXTERNAL EXPORTS\n%%%-------------------------------------------------------\ncreate_user(#{body := Body} = _Request) ->\n    Id = base64:encode(crypto:strong_rand_bytes(16)),\n    ets:insert(users, {Id, Body#{<<\"id\">> => Id}}),\n    {201, [], Body#{<<\"id\">> => Id}}.\n\nget_user(#{path_parameters := PathParameters} = _Request) ->\n    Id = proplists:get_value(<<\"userId\">>, PathParameters),\n    case ets:lookup(users, Id) of\n        [] ->\n            {404, [], #{\n                <<\"message\">> =>\n                    <<\"User \", Id/binary, \" not found\">>\n            }};\n        [{Id, User}] ->\n            {200, [], User}\n    end.\n\ndelete_user(#{path_parameters := PathParameters} = _Request) ->\n    Id = proplists:get_value(<<\"userId\">>, PathParameters),\n    case ets:lookup(users, Id) of\n        [] ->\n            {404, [], #{\n                <<\"message\">> =>\n                    <<\"User \", Id/binary, \" not found\">>\n            }};\n        [_User] ->\n            ets:delete(users, Id),\n            {204, [], #{<<\"id\">> => Id}}\n    end.\n```\n\n4. Start an `erf` instance using the [`erf:start_link/1`](https://nomasystems.github.io/erf/erf.html#start_link/1) function under the supervisor of your application. For example:\n```erl\n-module(users_sup).\n\n%%% BEHAVIOURS\n-behaviour(supervisor).\n\n%%% START/STOP EXPORTS\n-export([start_link/0]).\n\n%%% INTERNAL EXPORTS\n-export([init/1]).\n\n%%%-------------------------------------------------------\n%%% START/STOP EXPORTS\n%%%-------------------------------------------------------\nstart_link() ->\n    supervisor:start_link({local, ?MODULE}, ?MODULE, []).\n\n%%%-------------------------------------------------------\n%%% INTERNAL EXPORTS\n%%%-------------------------------------------------------\ninit([]) ->\n    % Users storage\n    ets:new(users, [public, named_table]),\n    UsersAPIConf = #{\n        spec_path => <<\"priv/users.openapi.json\">>,\n        callback => users_callback,\n        preprocess_middlewares => [users_preprocess],\n        postprocess_middlewares => [users_postprocess],\n        port => 8080\n    },\n    UsersChildSpec = {\n        public_api_server,\n        {erf, start_link, [UsersAPIConf]},\n        permanent,\n        5000,\n        worker,\n        [erf]\n    },\n    {ok, {{one_for_one, 5, 10}, [UsersChildSpec]}}.\n```\nNotice the configured preprocess and postprocess middlewares. They implement a basic authorization mechanism, short-circuiting the request and returning a 403 HTTP error code if the `X-API-KEY: api-key` header is missing, and they print in console the time in microseconds that authorized requests take to complete.\n\n5. Start requesting your service.\n```sh\n$ curl -vvv 'localhost:8080/users' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-API-KEY: api-key' -d '{\"username\": \"foo\", \"password\": \"foobar\"}'\n*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8080...\n* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)\n> POST /users HTTP/1.1\n> Host: localhost:8080\n> User-Agent: curl/8.0.1\n> Accept: */*\n> Content-Type: application/json\n> Content-Length: 44\n>\n< HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n< connection: Keep-Alive\n< content-length: 73\n< content-type: application/json\n<\n* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact\n{\"id\":\"b7R7bJSbaTmoiWwecy2IwA==\",\"password\":\"foobar\",\"username\":\"foo\"}\n```\n\n## `erf` configuration\n\n`erf`'s main entry point (i.e., the `start_link/1` function) receives an API specification, a callback module and a set of optional values that enable its configuration.\n\nThe configuration is provided as map with the following type spec:\n```erl\n%%% erf.erl\n-type conf() :: #{\n    spec_path := binary(),\n    callback := module(),\n    port => inet:port_number(),\n    name => atom(),\n    spec_parser => module(),\n    preprocess_middlewares => [module()],\n    postprocess_middlewares => [module()],\n    ssl => boolean(),\n    certfile => binary(),\n    keyfile => binary(),\n    static_routes => [static_route()],\n    swagger_ui => boolean(),\n    min_acceptors => pos_integer(),\n    accept_timeout => pos_integer(),\n    request_timeout => pos_integer(),\n    header_timeout => pos_integer(),\n    body_timeout => pos_integer(),\n    max_body_size => pos_integer(),\n    log_level => logger:level()\n}.\n```\n\nA detailed description of each parameter can be found in the following list:\n- `spec_path` : Path to API specification file.\n- `callback`: Name of the callback module.\n- `port`: Port the server will listen to. Defaults to `8080`.\n- `name`: Name under which the server is registered. Defaults to `erf`.\n- `spec_parser`: Name of the specification parser module.

Defaults to `undefined`.\n- `keyfile`: Path to the SSL key file. Defaults to `undefined`.\n- `static_routes`: List of routes that serve static files. Defaults to `[]`.\n- `swagger_ui`: Boolean flag that enables/disables the Swagger UI. Defaults to `false`.\n- `min_acceptors`: Minimum number of acceptor processes.

Defaults to `30000`.\n- `max_body_size`: Maximum size in bytes for the body of allowed received messages. Defaults to `1024000`.\n- `log_level`: Severity associated to logged messages. Defaults to `error`.","ref":"readme.html#quickstart","title":"Quickstart - Overview","type":"extras"},{"doc":"`erf` dynamically generates a router that type check the received requests against the API specification. If the request passes the validation, it is deconstructed and passed to the middleware and callback modules. But, how do those middleware and callback modules must look like?\n\n- **Preprocess middlewares** receive a request, do something with it (such as adding an entry to an access log) and return it for the next middleware or callback module to process it. This allows each preprocess middleware to modify the content of the request, updating any of its fields such as the `context` field, specifically dedicated to store contextual information middlewares might want to provide. Preprocess middlewares can short-circuit the processing flow, returning `{stop, Response}` or `{stop, Response, Request}` instead of just `Request`. The first of those alternatives prevents the following preprocess middlewares to execute, as well as the callback module, skipping directly to the postprocess middlewares. The second alternative response format does the same but allows to modify the request information.\n\n- **Callback module**.\nThe router expects your callback module to export one function per operation defined in your API specification. It also expects each operation to include an `operationId` that, after being transformed to _snake_case_, will identify the function that is going to be called. Such function receives an `erf:request()` and must return an `erf:response()`.\n\n- **Postprocess middlewares** can also update the request, like the preprocess middlewares, by returning a `{erf:response(), erf:request()}` tuple or just return a `erf:response()` and leave the received request intact. This middlewares cannot short-circuit the processing flow.\n\nAn example of an API specification and a supported callback can be seen in [Quickstart](#quickstart). Files `users_preprocess.erl` and `users_postprocess.erl` under `examples/users` exemplify how to use `erf` middlewares. Try out the example by running `rebar3 as examples shell` from the root of this project.","ref":"readme.html#callback-modules-middlewares","title":"Callback modules & middlewares - Overview","type":"extras"},{"doc":"The design principles behind `erf` allow its instances to be reconfigured in runtime with no needed downtime. While not every configuration key is updatable once the server is started (e.g., the port), some interesting features of the framework can be updated on-the-fly.\n\nThe following type spec corresponds to the runtime configuration of an `erf` instance. At the same time, is the type spec of the second argument for the `erf:reload/2` function.\n```erl\n%%% erf_conf.erl\n-type t() :: #{\n    callback => module(),\n    log_level => logger:level(),\n    preprocess_middlewares => [module()],\n    postprocess_middlewares => [module()],\n    router => erl_syntax:syntaxTree(), % not manually updatable\n    router_mod => module(), % not manually updatable\n    spec_path => binary(),\n    spec_parser => module(),\n    static_routes => [erf:static_route()],\n    swagger_ui => boolean()\n}.\n```\n> __NOTE:__ the `router` and `router_mod` keys are not updatable as they are automatically computed when new configuration is provided.","ref":"readme.html#hot-configuration-reloading","title":"Hot-configuration reloading - Overview","type":"extras"},{"doc":"As shown in [`erf` configuration](#erf-configuration), the server supports routes that serve static files.

Assign the issue to yourself, so other developers know that you are already working on it. Don't be ashamed if you find later that you won't be able to solve the issue, just left it unassigned so someone else can work on it.\n3. Create a branch to solve the issue:\n   * If the issue has the label `documentation`:\n      - The new branch must be created from the branch named `develop`.\n      - The name of the new branch must be `docs/{IssueIdentifier}-{IssueTitle in kebab-case}`.\n   * If the issue has the label `bug`:\n      - The new branch must be created from the branch named `main`.\n      - The name of the new branch must be `fix/{IssueIdentifier}-{IssueTitle in kebab-case}`.\n   * If the issue has the label `enhancement`:\n      - The new branch must be created from the branch named `develop`.\n      - The name of the new branch must be `feat/{IssueIdentifier}-{IssueTitle in kebab-case}`.\n4. Make the changes in the new branch. Don't forget to:\n   * Add new test cases checking that the bug is solved / the new feature is successfully implemented.\n   * Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to create commit messages. If a commit closes an issue, the footer must include the expression `closes #IssueIdentifier`.\n5. When the issue is solved, create a new pull request:\n   * Add a description with the changes you've made.\n   * Link the issue to the PR.\n   * Left it unassigned, someone from the nomasystems group will review it as soon as possible.","ref":"contributing.html#development","title":"Development - Contributing","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.
